# Advent of Code Haskell Solutions

Solutions for problems created by [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

Most solutions were not written quickly as is typical for Advent of Code problems. I took my time with them, using the problems as a means and motivation to learn Haskell. Some solutions have been revisited at times to improve on them as I learn.

Hopefully my solutions are easy to read, and mostly idiomatic, other than the frequent use of partial functions.

If you have any constructive criticism you are willing to share, please create an issue and do so. I would love to read it.
