# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions.

Most solutions were not written quickly as is typical for Advent of Code problems. I took my time with them, using the problems as a means and motivation to learn languages. Some solutions have been revisited at times to improve on as I learn.

Hopefully my solutions are easy to read, and mostly idiomatic.

If you have any constructive criticism you are willing to share please create an issue and do so, I would appreciate it.

## Run Instructions

Start a nix development shell, then follow the instructions provided by the solve bash script. You may need to run `cabal update` to update the cabal package list.

```bash
nix develop
./solve
```
