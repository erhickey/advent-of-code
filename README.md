# Advent of Code Solutions

Solutions for problems created by [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

Most solutions were not written quickly as is typical for Advent of Code problems. I took my time with them, using the problems as a means and motivation to learn languages. Some solutions have been revisited at times to improve on them as I learn.

Hopefully my solutions are easy to read, and mostly idiomatic.

If you have any constructive criticism you are willing to share, please create an issue and do so. I would love to read it.
